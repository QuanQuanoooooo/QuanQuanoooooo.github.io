There is a glaring<sup>[2]</sup> counter-example: the global rise of central-bank independence in the past 25 years. In the 1970s it was normal for politicians to manipulate interest rates to boost their own popularity<sup>[3]</sup>. That led to a plague of inflation<sup>[4]</sup>. And so rich countries and many poorer ones shifted to a system in which politicians set a broad<sup>[5]</sup> goal—steady prices—and left independent central bankers to realise it.<sup>[6]</sup> In a single generation<sup>[7]</sup> billions of people around the world have grown used to<sup>[8]</sup> low and stable inflation and to the idea that the interest rates on their bank deposits and mortgages are under control.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] pay-off n.报酬,结果,发工资,结算<br>[2] glaring adj.显眼的<br>[3] popularity n.普及,流行;名气;受大众欢迎<br>[4] a plague of inflation 通货膨胀的泛滥   plague n.[c]泛滥 +of inflation n.[un]通货膨胀<br>[5] broad adj.广泛的;宽的;普遍的<br>[6] 因此/富国和许多穷国/转向了一种政治体制(system),在这种体制下/政客们/设定了/一个广泛的目标——稳定物价——并让独立的央行来/实现这一目标<br>[7] In A Single Generation 仅仅一代人<br>[8] grew used to 习惯于…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Today this success is threatened by a confluence<sup>[1]</sup> of populism, nationalism and economic forces that are making monetary<sup>[2]</sup> policy political again. President Donald Trump has demanded<sup>[3]</sup> that interest rates should be slashed<sup>[4]</sup>, speculated about firing the boss of the Federal Reserve and said he will nominate<sup>[5]</sup> Stephen Moore and Herman Cain, two unqualified cronies<sup>[6]</sup>, to its board<sup>[7]</sup>. Brexiteers rubbish<sup>[8]</sup> the competence and motives of the Bank of England, while in Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been in a tug-of-war<sup>[9]</sup> with the central bank. India’s government has replaced a capable central-bank chief with a pliant<sup>[10]</sup> insider who has cut rates ahead of an election. And as we report this week, many top jobs at the European Central Bank (ecb), including the presidency, are up for grabs<sup>[11]</sup>, and some could become part of a wider political struggle over who runs Europe’s institutions<sup>[12]</sup> (see article). There is a genuine<sup>[13]</sup> need for reflection on central banks’ objectives and tools. But dangerous forces are afoot<sup>[14]</sup> that could have alarming<sup>[15]</sup> consequences for economic stability.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] confluence n.合流处;汇合处 +of<br>[2] monetary adj.货币的<br>[3] demand v.强烈要求;需要 in demand 受欢迎的;happens on demand 一经要求<br>[4] slash v.大幅度削减<br>[5] nominate v.(为工作、职位)提名;任命;(某人或某物)被提名(某奖项)<br>[6] unqualified cronies 绝对的亲信 unqualified adj.完全的,不受限制的;无资格的 crony n.狐朋狗友<br>[7] board n.董事会<br>[8] rubbish v.把…说得一文不值<br>[9] tug-of-war n.拔河;势均力敌的争夺<br>[10] pliant adj.易受影响的,顺从的;易弯的,柔韧的<br>[11] up for grabs [美国俚语]易得的,可得的;供争夺的,供人竞争的<br>[12] 欧洲中央银行的许多高层职位/包括主席职位/都在争夺之中/其中一些可能会成为一场更广泛的政治斗争的一部分/这场政治斗争的焦点是谁来管理欧洲的机构<br>[13] genuine adj.真正的;真诚的;诚实可靠的<br>[14] afoot adj.在进行中的;在酝酿中的<br>[15] alarming adj.令人惊恐的</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem of politicisation<sup>[1]</sup> last became acute<sup>[2]</sup> in the 1970s. After the post-war<sup>[3]</sup> Bretton Woods currency<sup>[4]</sup> system collapsed, central banks failed to tame<sup>[5]</sup> racing<sup>[6]</sup> inflation because politicians, who pulled the strings<sup>[7]</sup>, were reluctant to bear the short-term cost of higher unemployment. Two decades of runaway<sup>[8]</sup> prices and crises led to a new orthodoxy<sup>[9]</sup> that central banks should be given operational autonomy to pursue an inflation target.<sup>[10]</sup> In the euro zone, Japan and Britain central banks became legally independent in the 1990s. In America the White House refrained<sup>[11]</sup> from even publicly discussing Fed policy (see Free exchange). This consensus survived the crash of 2007-08 and is one reason why<sup>[12]</sup> global inflation has been only 4% a year on average over the past two decades.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] politicisation n.政治化<br>[2] acute adj.严峻的;急性的;敏锐的<br>[3] post-war adj.(尤指二战)战后的<br>[4] currency n.货币<br>[5] tame v.驯化 adj.驯服的;软弱的,乏味的 [未能抑制不断加剧的通胀]<br>[6] race v.(向某种状态或位置)快速发展,快速运动+toward;(尤指在面临困难或危险时大脑)急速运转 mind races<br>[7] pull the strings v.在幕后操纵<br>[8] runaway adj.迅猛发展而难以控制的;(车辆或动物)失控的<br>[9] orthodoxy n.[c]正统观念;[un]正统信仰<br>[10] 各国央行应被给予/追求通胀目标的/操作自主权<br>[11] refrain v.忍住;克制 +from doing sth[避免公开讨论]<br>[12] 这也是(过去二十年全球通货膨胀率平均每年仅为4％)的原因之一</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The fraying<sup>[1]</sup> of central banks’ independence has several causes. One is populism. Leaders like Mr Trump combine the politician’s desire for low interest rates with a reckless<sup>[2]</sup> urge to undermine institutions.<sup>[3]</sup> Another is the scope of central banks’ activities, which expanded after the financial crisis. Most now hold huge portfolios<sup>[4]</sup> of government bonds<sup>[5]</sup> while, at the same time policing<sup>[6]</sup> the financial industry.<sup>[7]</sup> And the record of central banks is far from perfect. Because they have probably been too hawkish<sup>[8]</sup> (despite their unconventional policies) the recovery from the crisis has been slow, undermining<sup>[9]</sup> voters’ faith in the technocrats<sup>[10]</sup> whose loyalty is supposedly to the public interest.<sup>[11]</sup>  All this makes it easier to view them as political. Meanwhile, the memory of the crises that led to independence has faded.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] fray v.磨损;烦躁<br>[2] reckless adj.鲁莽的;不顾后果的<br>[3] 将/这位政治家/对低利率/的渴望/与/破坏制度(undermine institutions)的/鲁莽冲动/结合在一起<br>[4] portfolios n.(用于参赛或求职的)作品选辑;投资组合;(高官的)职责<br>[5] government bond n.公债;[财政]政府公债<br>[6] police v.维持…的治安;监督<br>[7] 现在/大多数银行/持有/庞大的/政府债券/组合,同时/监管金融业<br>[8] hawkish adj.(政客或政府)鹰派的;强硬派的<br>[9] undermine v.逐渐削弱,逐渐动摇;(通常以间接方式)动摇(某人的地位或权威);破坏,损害(某人的努力或成功的机会)<br>[10] technocrat n.技术专家官员;技术官僚<br>[11] 因为/他们可能/过于强硬(尽管他们采取了/非常规的/政策),从危机中/复苏/缓慢,削弱了/选民/对技术官僚的/信心,而这些技术官僚的忠诚/理应是(supposedly)/为了公众利益 supposedly adv.可能;按照推测;恐怕</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pressure is manifesting<sup>[1]</sup> itself in different ways in different places. Mr Trump has launched an attack on<sup>[2]</sup> the Fed. Although his legal authority to sack<sup>[3]</sup> Jerome Powell, its chairman and a Trump appointee<sup>[4]</sup>, is not clear, if he wins re-election in 2020 he will be able to nominate a new Fed chairman and two more governors. In Europe a flurry of<sup>[5]</sup> job changes threatens<sup>[6]</sup> to lower the calibre<sup>[7]</sup> of decision-making at the ecb and feed underlying disagreements.<sup>[8]</sup> By the end of the year, three members of the six-strong executive board<sup>[9]</sup> and eight of the 19 national governors, who also vote on rates, will have left. The most notable of these is Mario Draghi, its head. His departure<sup>[10]</sup> in October will happen almost concurrently with<sup>[11]</sup> elections and a change in leadership at the European Commission and Council, a once-in-40-years overlap. Behind the political game of revolving<sup>[12]</sup> chairs is a battle between countries to control policy. Northern Europeans have been suspicious<sup>[13]</sup> of the ecb’s bond-buying, seeing it as cover for subsidising<sup>[14]</sup> southern Europe. Rather than win by force of argument, they are seeking an edge<sup>[15]</sup> by getting their own people into the top jobs. That will store up<sup>[16]</sup> problems.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] manifest adj.明显的;v.显现出 +itself 显露<br>[2] launch an attack on 发难;开始攻击<br>[3] sack v.开除 appointee n.被任命者<br>[4] appointee n.被任命者<br>[5] a flurry of 一阵风;一阵(一般是指急促发生的事情)<br>[6] threaten v.威胁;(坏事)可能发生<br>[7] calibre n.能力,才干;质量<br>[8] 在欧洲/一连串的(a flurry of)/职位变动可能会(threaten to)降低欧洲央行的决策水平/并加剧潜在的分歧(feed underlying disagreements) underlying adj.潜在的;在下面的<br>[9] executive board 执行委员会 board n.董事会;委员会,局<br>[10] departure n.离开;背离<br>[11] concurrently with …的同时;并发[他10月份的离职/几乎与/选举和欧盟委员会和理事会领导层的变化/同时出现/这是40年一遇的重叠]<br>[12] revolve v.以…为中心;围绕(某个主题)+around[在轮换主席的政治游戏背后/是各国为控制政策而展开的斗争]<br>[13] suspicious adj.怀疑的<br>[14] subsidise v.补贴+sth<br>[15] seek an edge[他们不是靠辩论的说服力/而是通过/让自己的员工进入高层职位/来寻求优势] argument n.讨论,辩论;争吵<br>[16] store up 储存,积聚</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps global inflation will rise again from its grave, in which case<sup>[1]</sup> weaker central banks may struggle<sup>[2]</sup> to kill it off<sup>[3]</sup>. More likely is an economic downturn<sup>[4]</sup>. The world economy has decelerated this year—on April 9th the imf downgraded its forecasts<sup>[5]</sup>. Central banks may find themselves needing to pep up<sup>[6]</sup> their economies.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] in which case 在这种情况下<br>[2] struggle v.艰难地移动+to;在困境中挣扎,竭力维持;努力,斗争<br>[3] kill it v.把…灭绝,消灭<br>[4] downturn n.衰退 decelerate v.减速;减缓 downgrade v.降级;降职<br>[5] forecast n.预报;预言 downgrade forecast 下调预估<br>[6] pep up 使振奋;使活跃;使更有趣;使更强大</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is what makes<sup>[1]</sup> today’s politicisation so dangerous. Technocrats<sup>[2]</sup> face a difficult challenge. The rich world has hardly any room to cut interest rates before hitting<sup>[3]</sup> zero, so central banks will once again have to turn to unconventional stimulus, such as bond-buying.<sup>[4]</sup> The Fed and other central banks may also need to co-operate globally, as in the wake of<sup>[5]</sup> the crisis. The ecb will have to convince markets that it will do whatever it takes<sup>[6]</sup> to contain<sup>[7]</sup> another financial panic on Europe’s periphery<sup>[8]</sup>. The presence of political appointees, who are either ill-qualified<sup>[9]</sup> or northern European hawks, would make all these tasks harder. It is not just that their votes count<sup>[10]</sup>, but also that they would poison<sup>[11]</sup> the public debate about what central banks should and should not do to deal with recessions.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] This is what makes 这就是…的原因<br>[2] technocrats n.技术专家官员;技术官僚<br>[3] hit v.猛撞;击中;对…造成严重影响;使突然意识到 ideas hit you;达到+point<br>[4] 在利率降至(hit)零之前/发达国家/几乎没有/降息的/空间(hardly any room)因此/各国央行/将不得不(have to)再次(once again)转向/债券购买等/非常规/刺激措施<br>[5] in the wake of 紧紧跟随;随着…而来;作为…的结果;仿效 [就像危机过后那样]<br>[6] do whatever it takes 全力以赴;竭尽所能;不惜一切代价去 +to<br>[7] contain v.控制;阻止<br>[8] periphery n.边缘 [欧洲央行/必须/让市场相信(不得不说服市场)/它将尽一切努力/遏制/欧洲外围国家/再次出现/金融恐慌]<br>[9] ill-qualified adj.不合格的<br>[10] count v.有价值,有重要意义sth/sb counts;看作+as;把…计算在内<br>[11] poison v.使中毒;毒死;污染;玷污,破环<br>[12] 这不仅是因为(It is not just that)/他们的选票很重要/还因为/他们会/毒害公众[关于/央行应对(deal with)衰退/应该做什么和不应该做什么的]辩论</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"The-talking-cure\"><a href=\"#The-talking-cure\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The talking cure\"></a>The talking cure</h3><p>It is right that the objectives and tools of monetary policy<sup>[1]</sup> are subject to<sup>[2]</sup> democratic scrutiny and that central bankers are accountable<sup>[3]</sup> to legislatures<sup>[4]</sup>. The Fed is reviewing its target in order to be prepared for a downturn. Other central banks should follow suit<sup>[5]</sup>. In the long run, this secures<sup>[6]</sup> their legitimacy<sup>[7]</sup> and hence<sup>[8]</sup> their independence. Yet in today’s political environment it is naive to think that politicians really want a considered<sup>[9]</sup> debate. Instead, the more central banks are in the limelight<sup>[10]</sup>, the more they will find their month-to-month decision-making subject to<sup>[11]</sup> external pressure, or find themselves at the whim of<sup>[12]</sup> boards packed with<sup>[13]</sup> hacks. It is just that sort of<sup>[14]</sup> politicisation that the theorists behind independent central banks wanted to avoid. Look back 40 years and you will get a flavour of<sup>[15]</sup> what could go wrong.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] monetary policy 货币政策 monetary adj.货币的<br>[2] subject to 使服从;使遭受;受…管制 subject adj.(可能)受…影响的be subject to sth;受…支配的;v.使遭受<br>[3] accountable adj.负有责任的<br>[4] legislature n.立法机构;议会   review v.(上级的)审查;审裁,审度;对(新作品)作评论<br>[5] follow suit 跟着做;学样<br>[6] secure v.争取到;使(某地)免遭伤害或攻击<br>[7] legitimacy n.合法;合理;正统=legality,. 此后 reasonableness<br>[8] hence adv.因此;此后[从长远来看，这确保了他们的合法性，从而确保了(hence)他们的独立性]<br>[9] considered adj.经过深思熟虑的<br>[10] limelight n.众人注意的中心<br>[11] make oneself subject to 使<br>[12] at the whim of 突然的念头;心血来潮的;一时兴起的<br>[13] pack with 塞进;挤进;塞满了东西;某地方挤满了人[他们越是发现/他们的月度决策/受到/外部压力的影响/或者发现自己/随心所欲地/被黑客/攻击]<br>[14] the sort of 那种;那一类的<br>[15] get a flavour of 尝到[您将会/对可能出现的问题/有所了解] </p>\n</blockquote>\n</body></html>","link":"/post/The-Economist-Week-8"}
