Sometimes the gene would be damaged or scrambled<sup>[1]</sup>, the copying imperfect or undertaken repeatedly. From that raw material arose the glories<sup>[2]</sup> of natural selection. But beneath it all, gene begat<sup>[3]</sup> gene.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] scramble v.攀登;使混杂,仓促凑成;扰乱<br>[2] glory 辉煌成就[从这种原料中产生了自然选择的光辉]<br>[3] beget v.导致;成为…的父亲[基因孕育了基因]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is no longer true. Now genes can be written from scratch<sup>[1]</sup> and edited repeatedly, like text in a word processor. The ability to engineer<sup>[2]</sup> living things which this provides represents a fundamental change in the way humans interact with the planet’s life. It permits the manufacture of all manner of<sup>[3]</sup> things which used to be hard, even impossible, to make: pharmaceuticals<sup>[4]</sup>, fuels, fabrics<sup>[5]</sup>, foods and fragrances<sup>[6]</sup> can all be built molecule by molecule. What cells do and what they can become is engineerable<sup>[7]</sup>, too. Immune<sup>[8]</sup> cells can be told to follow doctors’ orders; stem cells<sup>[9]</sup> better coaxed to turn into new tissues; fertilised eggs<sup>[10]</sup> programmed to grow into creatures quite unlike their parents.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] from scratch 从零开始<br>[2] engineer v.设计制造;策划<br>[3] all manner of adj.各种各样的;形形色色的(人,东西等)<br>[4] pharmaceuticals n.药品<br>[5] fabric 织物;(社会或系统的)结构<br>[6] fragrance n.香味;香味[它允许制造各种各样/过去很难,甚至不可能制造/的东西:药品、燃料、织物、食品和香水都可以一个分子一个分子地制造出来]<br>[7] engineerable adj.可以工程化的<br>[8] Immune cells 免疫细胞<br>[9] stem cells 干细胞 coax v.哄;劝诱<br>[10] fertilised eggs 受精卵<br>[11] 免疫细胞可以被告诉遵循医生的命令;干细胞被更好地诱导成新的组织;受精卵被编程成与父母完全不同的生物。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The earliest stages<sup>[1]</sup> of such “synthetic biology” are already changing many industrial processes, transforming medicine and beginning to reach into the consumer world (see Technology Quarterly). Progress may be slow, but with the help of new tools and a big dollop<sup>[2]</sup> of machine learning, biological manufacturing could eventually yield truly cornucopian<sup>[3]</sup> technologies. Buildings may be grown from synthetic wood or coral. Mammoths produced from engineered elephant cells may yet<sup>[4]</sup> stride across<sup>[5]</sup> Siberia.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] stage n.(活动、过程、时期的)阶段<br>[2] dollop n.[c]一大勺的量<br>[3] cornucopian adj.丰富的;富饶的[生物制造最终可能产生真正丰富的技术]<br>[4] yet adv.还(尤用以强调令人吃惊的事物)<br>[5] stride v.大步走;进入状态 get into your stride/hit your stride;从容处理某事take a problem or difficulty in stride</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The scale of the potential changes seems hard to imagine. But look back through history, and humanity’s relations with the living world<sup>[1]</sup> have seen three great transformations: the exploitation<sup>[2]</sup> of fossil fuels, the globalisation of the world’s ecosystems after the European conquest<sup>[3]</sup> of the Americas, and the domestication of crops and animals at the dawn of<sup>[4]</sup> agriculture. All brought prosperity and progress, but with damaging side-effects<sup>[5]</sup>. Synthetic biology promises<sup>[6]</sup> similar transformation. To harness<sup>[7]</sup> the promise and minimise the peril<sup>[8]</sup>, it pays to learn the lessons of the past<sup>[9]</sup>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] the living world 生活世界<br>[2] exploitation n.剥削[含贬义];开发,开采;充分利用<br>[3] conquest n.[un]征服;克服[欧洲征服美洲后世界生态系统的全球化]<br>[4] at the dawn of 在……的初期;在……的黎明<br>[5] side-effects 副作用<br>[6] promise v.承诺;向(某人)承诺(给予他们某物),向(某人)保证(他们获得某物);预示<br>[7] harness v.利用 promise n.[c]诺言;(un)(显示出)成功的迹象<br>[8] peril n.极大危险<br>[9] 吸取过去的教训是值得的</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"The-new-biology-calls-all-in-doubt\"><a href=\"#The-new-biology-calls-all-in-doubt\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The new biology calls all in doubt\"></a>The new biology calls all in doubt</h3><p>Start with the most recent of these previous shifts<sup>[1]</sup>. Fossil fuels have enabled humans to drive remarkable economic expansion in the present using biological productivity from ages past, stored away in coal and oil.<sup>[2]</sup> But much wilderness<sup>[3]</sup> has been lost, and carbon atoms which last saw the atmosphere hundreds of millions of years ago have strengthened the planet’s greenhouse effect to a degree that may prove catastrophic.<sup>[4]</sup> Here, synthetic biology can do good. It is already being used to replace some products made from petrochemicals<sup>[5]</sup>; in time<sup>[6]</sup> it could replace some fuels, too. This week Burger King introduced into some of its restaurants a beefless Whopper that gets its meatiness<sup>[7]</sup> from an engineered<sup>[8]</sup> plant protein; such innovations could greatly ease a shift to less environmentally taxing<sup>[9]</sup> diets. They could also be used to do more with less<sup>[10]</sup>. Plants and their soil microbes<sup>[11]</sup> could produce their own fertilisers<sup>[12]</sup> and pesticides<sup>[13]</sup>, ruminants less greenhouse gas—though to ensure that synthetic biology yields such laudable environmental goals will take public policy as well as the cues of the market.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] previous shift 以前的变化<br>[2] 化石燃料/使人类能够(利用/过去/储存在煤和石油中的/生物生产力)推动(drive)当今显著的(remarkable)经济扩张<br>[3] wilderness n.[c]荒野<br>[4] 几亿年前/最后一次/出现在大气中的/碳原子/已经加强了/地球的温室效应/其程度(to a degree that )可能被证明是灾难性的(catastrophic)<br>[5] petrochemical n.[c]石油化工产品<br>[6] in time n.及时,适时=in the nick of time, at the right moment[假以时日]<br>[7] meatiness 肉味<br>[8] engineered adj.设计的,工程[转基因植物蛋白/工程植物蛋白]<br>[9] taxing adj.费劲的<br>[10] do more with less 花小钱办大事<br>[11] microbe n.[c]微生物<br>[12] fertiliser n.化肥<br>[13] pesticide n.杀虫剂<br>[14] 反刍动物/可以减少/温室气体的排放——尽管/要确保/合成生物学/产生/如此/值得称赞的/环境目标/需要公共政策和市场的暗示</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second example of biological change sweeping<sup>[1]</sup> the world is the Columbian exchange, in which the 16th century’s newly global network of trade shuffled<sup>[2]</sup> together the creatures of the New World and the Old.<sup>[3]</sup> Horses, cattle<sup>[4]</sup> and cotton were introduced to the Americas; maize<sup>[5]</sup>, potatoes, chilli and tobacco to Europe, Africa and Asia. The ecosystems in which humans live became globalised as never before<sup>[6]</sup>, providing more productive agriculture all round<sup>[7]</sup>, richer diets for many. But there were also disastrous consequences. Measles, smallpox and other pathogens<sup>[8]</sup> ran through the New World like a forest fire, claiming<sup>[9]</sup> tens of millions of lives. The Europeans weaponise this catastrophe, conquering lands depleted and disordered by disease.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] sweeping adj.连绵曲折的;笼统的;(改变)意义深远的 sweep v.使迅速传播,迅速传播<br>[2] shuffle v.拖着脚走;(因不舒服或尴尬)站着的脚来回挪动,坐立不安;洗(牌)[shuffled together混杂在一起]<br>[3] 生物变化席卷世界的/第二个例子是/哥伦布交换(其中16世纪新形成的/全球贸易网络/将新世界和旧世界的生物/混杂在一起)<br>[4] cattle 牛 a herd of cattle 一群牛;twenty head of cattle (= twenty cows) 二十头牛<br>[5] maize [un]玉米<br>[6] as never before 前所未有地<br>[7] all round n. 周围，到处=all around, up and down[全面提高农业生产水平]<br>[8] Measles, smallpox and other pathogens 麻疹，天花和其他病原体<br>[9] claim v.索取;夺走(生命)accident claims sb’s life<br>[10] 欧洲人将这场灾难武器化(weaponise)征服了/因疾病而/枯竭和混乱的(depleted and disordered)土地</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Synthetic biology could create such weapons by design: pathogens designed to weaken, to incapacitate<sup>[1]</sup> or to kill, and perhaps also to limit themselves to particular types of target.<sup>[2]</sup> There is real cause for concern<sup>[3]</sup> here—but not for immediate alarm. For such weaponisation would, like the rest of<sup>[4]</sup> cutting-edge<sup>[5]</sup> synthetic biology, take highly skilled teams with significant resources. And armies already have lots of ways to flatten<sup>[6]</sup> cities and kill people in large numbers. When it comes to<sup>[7]</sup> mass destruction, a disease is a poor substitute<sup>[8]</sup> for a nuke. What’s more, today’s synthetic-biology community lives up to<sup>[9]</sup> ideals of openness and public service better than many older fields. Maintained and nurtured, that culture should serve as a powerful immune system against rogue<sup>[10]</sup> elements.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] incapacitate v.使…能力变弱;使伤残<br>[2] 合成生物学/可以通过设计/制造这样的武器:病原体旨在/削弱，致残或杀死/也可能/将自己局限于/特定类型的目标<br>[3] cause for concern 令人担心的原因<br>[4] the rest of 其余的,剩下的<br>[5] cutting-edge n.前沿 adj.尖端的<br>[6] flatten v.使变平,变平;夷平(建筑物、城镇或植物)<br>[7] When it comes to 当提到,就……而论<br>[8] substitute 以…代替,代替+for<br>[9] live up to 达到[今天的合成生物学社区/比许多更古老的领域/更符合/开放和公共服务的理想]<br>[10] rogue element 流氓元素 rogue adj.行为异常的 [保持和培养,文化应该成为一个强大的免疫系统/以防止流氓元素]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The earliest biological transformation—domestication—produced what was hitherto<sup>[1]</sup> the biggest change in how humans lived their lives. Haphazardly, then purposefully, humans bred cereals to be more bountiful<sup>[2]</sup>, livestock to be more docile<sup>[3]</sup>, dogs more obedient<sup>[4]</sup> and cats more companionable<sup>[5]</sup> (the last a partial success<sup>[6]</sup>, at best). This allowed new densities of settlement and new forms of social organisation: the market, the city, the state.<sup>[7]</sup> Humans domesticated themselves as well as their crops and animals, creating space for the drudgery<sup>[8]</sup> of subsistence<sup>[9]</sup> agriculture and oppressive political hierarchies.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] hitherto adv.迄今;至今[最早的生物转变——驯化——产生了/迄今为止/人类生活方式中(in how)/最大的变化]<br>[2] bountiful adj.丰富的,大量的;(地域或时期)物产丰富的<br>[3] docile adj.易管教的;温顺的,驯服的<br>[4] obedient adj.顺从的;服从的<br>[5] companionable adj.友善的;好交往的<br>[6] the last a partial success, at best 最后一种方式充其量只能算是部分成功 partial adj.部分的;偏爱的;偏袒的<br>[7] allow v.使能够(发生);(在计划中)酌留[这使得/新的聚落密度/和新的社会组织形式/成为可能]<br>[8] drudgery n.[un]苦差事<br>[9] subsistence n.[un]生存;自给自足的<br>[10] 人类/不仅驯养了农作物和动物/也驯养了自己/为(自给自足的农业和压迫性的政治等级制度的)苦差事创造了空间。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Synthetic biology will have a similar cascading effect<sup>[1]</sup>, transforming humans’ relationships with each other and, potentially, their own biological nature.<sup>[2]</sup> The ability to reprogram the embryo<sup>[3]</sup> is, rightly, the site of<sup>[4]</sup> most of today’s ethical concerns<sup>[5]</sup>. In future, they may extend further<sup>[6]</sup>; what should one make of<sup>[7]</sup> people with the upper-body strength of gorillas<sup>[8]</sup>, or minds impervious<sup>[9]</sup> to sorrow<sup>[10]</sup>? How humans may choose to change themselves biologically is hard to say; that some choices will be controversial is not.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] cascading effect 级联效应;连锁效应<br>[2] 合成生物学将产生类似的连锁效应/改变人类彼此之间的(with each other)关系/并可能改变人类自身的生物学性质<br>[3] embryo n.[c]胚胎 adj.萌芽阶段的<br>[4] the site of ……的地点<br>[5] ethical concern 道德牵制;伦理关怀[对胚胎/进行重新编程的能力/是当今大多数伦理问题的/焦点]<br>[6] extend further 进一步延伸 further adv.在更大程度上;更进一步地;更深入地;更远地<br>[7] make of 从(某事物)中得出(某印象、看法、理解等)<br>[8] 我们应该如何看待/拥有大猩猩(gorillas)上半身力量/的人/或者不受悲伤影响(impervious to sorrow)的人<br>[9] impervious adj.无动于衷的,不受影响的;防渗漏的,不让穿过的<br>[10] sorrow n.[un]悲伤;歉疚<br>[11] 有些选择将会引起争议，但事实并非如此(is not)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which leads to the main way in which this transformation differs from the three that came before.<sup>[1]</sup> Their significance was discovered only in retrospect<sup>[2]</sup>. This time, there will be foresight<sup>[3]</sup>. It will not be perfect: there will certainly be unanticipated<sup>[4]</sup> effects. But synthetic biology will be driven by the pursuit<sup>[5]</sup> of goals, both anticipated and desired.<sup>[6]</sup> It will challenge the human capacity for wisdom and foresight. It might defeat it. But carefully nurtured, it might also help expand it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] 这就引出了(leads to)这个转变/与之前三个转变的/主要不同之处 [这导致了主要方式(Which leads to the main way)在其中(in which)]<br>[2] in retrospect 回想[他们的重要性只有在事后(回想起)才被发现]<br>[3] foresight n.[un]先见之明<br>[4] unanticipated adj.出乎意料的;未预见到的<br>[5] pursuit n.[un]追求;执行;追赶[c]消遣活动<br>[6] 但是/合成生物学/将由/对预期和期望/目标的追求(pursuit)所驱动</p>\n</blockquote>\n</body></html>","link":"/post/The-Economist-Week-7"}
