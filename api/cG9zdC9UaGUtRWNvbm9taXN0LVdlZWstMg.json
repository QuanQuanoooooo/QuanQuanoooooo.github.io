The second was during the cold war, when East and West vied for the allegiance of<sup>[4]</sup> newly independent African states; the Soviet Union backed<sup>[5]</sup> Marxist tyrants<sup>[6]</sup> while America propped up<sup>[7]</sup> despots<sup>[8]</sup> who claimed to believe in capitalism<sup>[9]</sup>. A third surge, now under way<sup>[10]</sup>, is more benign<sup>[11]</sup>. Outsiders<sup>[12]</sup> have noticed that the continent is important and becoming more so, not least because of its growing share of the global population (by 2025 the UN predicts that there will be more Africans than Chinese people).<sup>[13]</sup> Governments and businesses from all around the world are rushing to<sup>[14]</sup> strengthen diplomatic, strategic and commercial ties<sup>[15]</sup>. This creates vast opportunities. If Africa handles the new scramble wisely, the main winners will be Africans themselves.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] surge n./v.剧增[第一次外国对非洲兴趣大增]<br>[2] dubbed the “scramble” 被称为“争夺” (1)dub 把…称为 sb or sth is dubbed a particular thing (2)scramble 争夺 sb scramble for sth<br>[3] carve up 瓜分 carves sth up; seize v.抓住;攻占;夺取<br>[4] vie for the allegiance of 争取…的忠诚 (1)vie 竞争 ~ with another for sth (2)allegiance n.拥护<br>[5] back v.支持<br>[6] Marxist tyrants 马克思主义的暴君<br>[7] prop up 支撑;维持<br>[8] despot n.专制者<br>[9] capitalism 资本主义<br>[10] now under way 现在正在进行<br>[11] benign adj.和善的;无害的;良性的;宜人的<br>[12] Outsider n.局外人[外界]<br>[13] not least 尤其相当重要地 [外界已经注意到非洲大陆的重要性，而且正变得越来越重要，尤其是/因为/它在全球人口中/所占的比例/越来越大(联合国预测，到2025年非洲人口将超过中国人口)]<br>[14] rushing to 急着(做) rush to do sth<br>[15] 世界各国/政府和企业/都急于/加强外交、战略和商业关系。diplomacy-diplomatic[外交]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The extent of foreign engagement is unprecedented (see Briefing). Start with diplomacy. From 2010 to 2016 more than 320 embassies<sup>[1]</sup> were opened in Africa, probably the biggest embassy-building boom<sup>[2]</sup> anywhere, ever. Turkey alone opened 26. Last year India announced it would open 18. Military ties<sup>[3]</sup> are deepening, too. America and France are lending muscle<sup>[4]</sup> and technology to the struggle against<sup>[5]</sup> jihadism<sup>[6]</sup> in the Sahel. China is now the biggest arms seller to sub-Saharan<sup>[7]</sup> Africa and has defence-technology<sup>[8]</sup> ties with 45 countries. Russia has signed 19 military deals with<sup>[9]</sup> African states since 2014. Oil-rich Arab states are building bases on the Horn of Africa<sup>[10]</sup> and hiring African mercenaries<sup>[11]</sup>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] embassy n.大使及其随员;大使馆<br>[2] boom n.(经济)繁荣;增长 v.激增[这可能是有史以来最大的大使馆建设热潮 anywhere, ever]<br>[3] Military ties 军事关系[两国军事关系也在不断深化]<br>[4] muscle n.影响力 flexes its muscles 显示实力<br>[5] the struggle against 反…的斗争<br>[6] jihadism 圣战运动 [美国和法国正在为萨赫勒地区打击圣战主义的斗争提供力量和技术]<br>[7] sub-Saharan [sub-表示“下、在下”；表示“附属、下属”；表示“低于、次于”]<br>[8] defence-technology 国防科技<br>[9] sign deal with 与…签约 [俄罗斯与非洲国家签署了19项军事协议]<br>[10] The Horn of Africa 非洲之角<br>[11] mercenary n.雇佣兵;adj.惟利是图的 </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Commercial ties are being upended<sup>[1]</sup>. As recently as 2006 Africa’s three biggest trading partners were America, China and France, in that order. By 2018 it was China first, India second and America third (France was seventh). Over the same period Africa’s trade has more than trebled<sup>[2]</sup> with Turkey and Indonesia, and more than quadrupled<sup>[3]</sup> with Russia. Trade with the European Union has grown by a more modest<sup>[4]</sup> 41%. The biggest sources of foreign direct investment are still firms from America, Britain and France, but Chinese ones, including state-backed outfits<sup>[5]</sup>, are catching up, and investors from India and Singapore are eager to join the fray<sup>[6]</sup>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] upend v.颠倒[系正在被颠覆]<br>[2] treble (1)v.使增加两倍;增加两倍 (2)PREDET 3倍的 [非洲与土耳其和印度尼西亚的贸易增长了两倍多]<br>[3] quadruple (1)v.使成4倍;成为4倍 (2)PREDET 4倍的<br>[4] modest (1)adj.适度的;(数量、比率或改进幅度等)较小的;谦虚的 sb ~ (2)adv.较小地;谦虚地<br>[5] state-backed outfits 国家支持的机构  state-backed 国家支持的 outfit n.全套服装;机构<br>[6] fray v.磨损;烦躁 n.大声争论;打架;争吵 join the fray 加入战斗/加入竞争 [正在迎头赶上(are catching up)]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The stereotype<sup>[1]</sup> of foreigners in Africa is of neocolonial exploiters<sup>[2]</sup>, interested only in the continent’s natural resources, not its people, and ready to bribe<sup>[3]</sup> local bigwigs<sup>[4]</sup> in shady<sup>[5]</sup> deals that do nothing for ordinary Africans.<sup>[6]</sup> The stereotype is sometimes true. Far too many oil and mineral ventures<sup>[7]</sup> are dirty. Corrupt<sup>[8]</sup> African leaders, of whom there is still an abundance, can always find foreign enablers<sup>[9]</sup> to launder the loot<sup>[10]</sup>. And contracts with firms from countries that care little for<sup>[11]</sup> transparency, such as China and Russia, are often murky<sup>[12]</sup>. Three Russian journalists were murdered<sup>[13]</sup> last year while investigating a Kremlin-linked<sup>[14]</sup> mercenary outfit that reportedly<sup>[15]</sup> protects the president of the war-torn<sup>[16]</sup> Central African Republic and enables diamond-mining there.<sup>[17]</sup> Understandably, many saw a whiff of old-fashioned imperialism<sup>[18]</sup>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] stereotype [刻板印象] n.模式化形象;成见 v.把…模式化;对…产生成见<br>[2] neocolonial exploiters 新殖民主义剥削者 neocolonial adj.新殖民主义的 exploiter n.剥削者<br>[3] bribe n.[c]/v.贿赂<br>[4] bigwig n.[c]头儿(权贵之人;有重大影响的人)<br>[5] shady adj.(1)阴凉的;背阴的(2)可疑的;不法的<br>[6] 外国人在非洲的/刻板印象是/新殖民主义的剥削者,他们只对非洲大陆的自然资源感兴趣,而对非洲人民没有兴趣,他们/准备/贿赂当地的权贵,进行/对普通非洲人毫无益处的/不正当/交易.<br>[7] venture n.风险项目;冒险活动 v.冒险去(某处) ~ sw;冒险(做某事) ~ to do sth;试探地提出(问题或观点) ~ a question or statement;冒险(从事活动) ~ into an activity [太多的石油和矿产企业是肮脏的]<br>[8] corrupt adj.腐败的 v.使…腐化;腐化sb is corrupted by sth;使…堕落 ~ sb<br>[9] enabler n.促成事情成功的人或因素<br>[10] launder the loot 洗黑钱 launder v.洗(钱) n.洗钱者 loot 赃物[仍然有大量腐败的非洲领导人总能找到外国的帮凶来洗黑钱]<br>[11] care little for 不注重 [与中国和俄罗斯等/几乎不关心透明度的/国家的/公司/签订的/合同/往往是/模糊不清的]<br>[12] murky adj.阴暗的;混浊的;含糊不清的; 晦涩难懂的<br>[13] murder v./n.谋杀 (sb gets away with murder)无法无天为所欲为<br>[14] link 认为…有关联 ~ sb or sth to another [investigate n./v.调查 Kremlin-linked 与克里姆林宫有关的]<br>[15] reportedly adv.据报道;据说<br>[16] war-torn adj.受战争严重破坏的;饱受战争蹂躏的<br>[17] 去年,三名俄罗斯记者在调查一个与克里姆林宫有关联的雇佣军组织时被谋杀,据报道,该组织保护饱受战争蹂躏的中非共和国的总统,并在那里开采钻石.<br>[18] a whiff of old-fashioned imperialism 一丝旧式帝国主义的味道 a whiff of 一点点;一股…味道 old-fashion 老式的 imperialism n.[un]帝国主义</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, engagement<sup>[1]</sup> with the outside world has mostly been positive for Africans. Foreigners build ports, sell insurance and bring mobile-phone technology. Chinese factories hum<sup>[2]</sup> in Ethiopia and Rwanda. Turkish Airlines flies to more than 50 African cities. Greater openness to trade and investment is one reason why gdp per head south of the Sahara is two-fifths higher than it was in 2000.<sup>[3]</sup> (Sounder macroeconomic policies<sup>[4]</sup> and fewer wars also helped.) Africans can benefit when foreigners buy everything from<sup>[5]</sup> textiles to holidays and digital services.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] engagement (与…的)密切关系   + with/in<br>[2] hum v.发出连续低沉的声音;a place hums (地方) 繁忙[中国工厂在埃塞俄比亚和卢旺达蓬勃发展]<br>[3] 投资是撒哈拉以南地区人均gdp比2000年高出五分之二的原因之一。<br>[4] Sounder macroeconomic policies 健全的宏观经济政策 sound sdj. 健康的;状况良好的;可靠的;正确的 macroeconomic adj.宏观经济的<br>[5] buy everything from … to … 购买从纺织品到假日和数字服务的所有东西</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even so, Africans can do more to increase their share of<sup>[1]</sup> the benefits. First, voters and activists can insist on transparency. It is heartening<sup>[2]</sup> that South Africa is investigating the allegedly crooked deals<sup>[3]</sup> struck<sup>[4]</sup> under the previous president, Jacob Zuma, but alarming<sup>[5]</sup> that even worse behaviour in the Democratic Republic of Congo has gone unprobed<sup>[6]</sup>, and that the terms<sup>[7]</sup> of Chinese loans to some dangerously indebted<sup>[8]</sup> African governments are secret.<sup>[9]</sup> To be sure that a public deal is good for ordinary folk as well as big men, voters have to know what is in it. Journalists, such as the Kenyans who exposed scandals over<sup>[10]</sup> a Chinese railway project, have a big role to play<sup>[11]</sup>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] share of …的份额;…的部份 e.g.share of the benefits 增加从中获得的好处<br>[2] hearten v.鼓舞 adj.受到鼓舞的<br>[3] allegedly crooked deals 涉嫌欺诈的交易 allegedly adv.据称 crooked adj.扭曲的;腐败的; 恶棍般的<br>[4] strike 达成 (交易或协议 ~ a deal or a bargain with sb<br>[5] alarming adj.令人惊恐的 adj.(1)阴凉的;背阴的(2)可疑的;不法的<br>[6] gone unprobed 没有受到调查 probe v.调查;探寻<br>[7] terms 条款 the terms of an agreement, treaty, or other arrangement<br>[8] indebted adj.负债的<br>[9] 令人振奋的是，南非正在调查前总统雅各布•祖马(Jacob Zuma)任内达成的涉嫌欺诈的交易，但令人担忧的是，刚果民主共和国(Democratic Republic of Congo)甚至更糟糕的交易/也没有受到调查，而且/中国/向一些负债严重的/非洲国家政府/提供贷款的条款/是保密的。<br>[10] expose scandals over 揭露丑闻<br>[11] have a big role to play 扮演重要角色/发挥重要作用</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Second, Africa’s leaders need to think more strategically<sup>[1]</sup>. Africa may be nearly as populous as China, but it comprises<sup>[2]</sup> 54 countries, not one. African governments could strike better deals<sup>[3]</sup> if they showed more unity<sup>[4]</sup>. No one expects a heterogeneous continent that includes both anarchic battle zones<sup>[5]</sup> and prosperous democracies<sup>[6]</sup> to be as integrated as Europe. But it can surely do better than letting China negotiate<sup>[7]</sup> with each country individually, behind closed doors.<sup>[8]</sup> The power imbalance between, say, China and Uganda is huge. It could be reduced somewhat with a free-trade area or if African regional blocs clubbed together<sup>[9]</sup> . After all<sup>[10]</sup>, the benefits of infrastructure<sup>[11]</sup> projects spill across<sup>[12]</sup> borders.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] strategically adv. 战略性地<br>[2] comprise v.包含; 由…组成 sth comprises or is comprised of<br>[3] strike deal 达成协议<br>[4] unity n.统一;团结;一致<br>[5] anarchic battle zones 无政府主义的战区 anarchic adj.无政府的;无秩序的,混乱的<br>[6] prosperous democracies 繁荣的民主国家 democracy n.民主政体[un];民主国家[c]<br>[7] negotiate v.谈判 ~ with each other or ~ an agreement, 条款 the terms of an agreement, treaty, or other arrangement<br>[8] 没有人期望/一个包括/无政府主义战区/和繁荣的民主国家/在内的/多元化大陆/能像欧洲/那样一体化。但它肯定能做得比/让中国与每个国家/单独进行/闭门/谈判/更好。<br>[9] regional blocs club together 区域集团联合起来 bloc n.(具有相似政治目标和利益的国家结成的)阵营 club together v.协作=team up<br>[10] after all 毕竟;终究<br>[11] infrastructure n.(国家、社会、组织赖以行使职能的)基础设施<br>[12] spill across 散落在<br>[13] 毕竟,基础设施项目的好处跨越国界</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Third, African leaders do not have to choose sides<sup>[1]</sup>, as they did during the cold war. They can do business with Western democracies and also with China and Russia—and anyone else with something to offer. Because they have more choice now than ever before, Africans should be able to drive harder bargains<sup>[2]</sup>. And outsiders should not see this as a zero-sum contest<sup>[3]</sup> (as the Trump administration<sup>[4]</sup>, when it pays attention to Africa, apparently does). If China builds a bridge in Ghana, an American car can drive over it. If a British firm invests in a mobile-data network in Kenya, a Kenyan entrepreneur<sup>[5]</sup> can use it to set up a cross-border startup<sup>[6]</sup>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] sides  n.(战争、争论或谈判中的)一方 v.支持 ~ with 站在一起反对 ~ against<br>[2] drive harder bargains 更拼命的地讨价还价If people drive a hard bargain, they argue with determination in order to achieve a deal which is favourable to themselves.  harder adj.更难的;更努力的;更坚固的 bargains n.[c]协议(尤指正式商业合同);[un]谈判;讨价还价<br>[3] contest n.竞赛;争夺 v.对…提出抗辩;参加 竞选或比赛)<br>[4] administration n.[un]行政工作;管理工作;监管[c]政府(尤用于美国)<br>[5] entrepreneur 创业者<br>[6] set up a cross-border startup 建立一个跨境创业公司 set up 开办;开创事业 cross-border adj.(公司)跨国的;(袭击)跨越国境的startup n.新创办的小公司</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Last, Africans should take what some of their new friends tell them with a pinch of salt<sup>[1]</sup>. China argues that democracy is a Western idea; development requires a firm<sup>[2]</sup> hand. This message no doubt appeals to African strongmen, but it is bunk<sup>[3]</sup>. A study by Takaaki Masaki of the World Bank and Nicolas van de Walle of Cornell University found that African countries grow faster if they are more democratic. The good news is that, as education improves and Africans move rapidly to the cities, they are growing more critical<sup>[4]</sup> of their rulers, and less frightened<sup>[5]</sup> to say so. In 1997, 70% of African ruling parties won more than 60% of the vote, partly by getting rural chiefs<sup>[6]</sup> to cow<sup>[7]</sup> villagers into backing them. By 2015 only 50% did. As politics grows more competitive, voters’ clout<sup>[8]</sup> will grow. And they will be able to insist on a form of globalisation that works for Africans and foreigners alike<sup>[9]</sup>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] take sth with a pinch of salt 将信将疑;有所保留地看待<br>[2] firm hand 牢固控制;铁腕;强硬的态度 firm adj.结实的;强有力的<br>[3] it is bunk 这是胡扯;这是一派胡言 bunk-&gt;bunkum n.[un]胡言<br>[4] critical adj.批评的 To be ~ of sb or sth means to criticize them;关键的;危急的;病危的<br>[5] frightened adj.害怕的[他们对统治者的批评越来越多，并且不那么害怕这样说]<br>[6] rural chiefs 农村地区的领导人 rural adj.乡村的;有乡村特色的农村的首领 chief n.长官;(部落)首领 adj.首席的;首要的<br>[7] cow v.恐吓;威胁 ~ sb into sth [胁迫村民支持他们]<br>[8] clout n.[un]影响力<br>[9] alike adj.相似的two or more things are alike adv.相似地[他们将能够坚持一种适用于非洲人和外国人的全球化形式]</p>\n</blockquote>\n","link":"/post/The-Economist-Week-2"}
