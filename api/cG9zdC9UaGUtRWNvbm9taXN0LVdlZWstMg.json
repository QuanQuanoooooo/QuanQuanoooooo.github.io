The second was during the cold war, when East and West vied for the allegiance of<sup>[4]</sup> newly independent African states; the Soviet Union backed<sup>[5]</sup> Marxist tyrants<sup>[6]</sup> while America propped up<sup>[7]</sup> despots<sup>[8]</sup> who claimed to believe in capitalism<sup>[9]</sup>. A third surge, now under way<sup>[10]</sup>, is more benign<sup>[11]</sup>. Outsiders<sup>[12]</sup> have noticed that the continent is important and becoming more so, not least because of its growing share of the global population (by 2025 the UN predicts that there will be more Africans than Chinese people).<sup>[13]</sup> Governments and businesses from all around the world are rushing to<sup>[14]</sup> strengthen diplomatic, strategic and commercial ties<sup>[15]</sup>. This creates vast opportunities. If Africa handles the new scramble wisely, the main winners will be Africans themselves.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] surge n./v.剧增[第一次外国对非洲兴趣大增]<br>[2] dubbed the “scramble” 被称为“争夺” (1)dub 把…称为 sb or sth is dubbed a particular thing (2)scramble 争夺 sb scramble for sth<br>[3] carve up 瓜分 carves sth up; seize v.抓住;攻占;夺取<br>[4] vie for the allegiance of 争取…的忠诚 (1)vie 竞争 ~ with another for sth (2)allegiance n.拥护<br>[5] back v.支持<br>[6] Marxist tyrants 马克思主义的暴君<br>[7] prop up 支撑;维持<br>[8] despot n.专制者<br>[9] capitalism 资本主义<br>[10] now under way 现在正在进行<br>[11] benign adj.和善的;无害的;良性的;宜人的<br>[12] Outsider n.局外人[外界]<br>[13] not least 尤其相当重要地 [外界已经注意到非洲大陆的重要性，而且正变得越来越重要，尤其是/因为/它在全球人口中/所占的比例/越来越大(联合国预测，到2025年非洲人口将超过中国人口)]<br>[14] rushing to 急着(做) rush to do sth<br>[15] 世界各国/政府和企业/都急于/加强外交、战略和商业关系。diplomacy-diplomatic[外交]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The extent of foreign engagement is unprecedented (see Briefing). Start with diplomacy. From 2010 to 2016 more than 320 embassies<sup>[1]</sup> were opened in Africa, probably the biggest embassy-building boom<sup>[2]</sup> anywhere, ever. Turkey alone opened 26. Last year India announced it would open 18. Military ties<sup>[3]</sup> are deepening, too. America and France are lending muscle<sup>[4]</sup> and technology to the struggle against<sup>[5]</sup> jihadism<sup>[6]</sup> in the Sahel. China is now the biggest arms seller to sub-Saharan<sup>[7]</sup> Africa and has defence-technology<sup>[8]</sup> ties with 45 countries. Russia has signed 19 military deals with<sup>[9]</sup> African states since 2014. Oil-rich Arab states are building bases on the Horn of Africa<sup>[10]</sup> and hiring African mercenaries<sup>[11]</sup>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] embassy n.大使及其随员;大使馆<br>[2] boom n.(经济)繁荣;增长 v.激增[这可能是有史以来最大的大使馆建设热潮 anywhere, ever]<br>[3] Military ties 军事关系[两国军事关系也在不断深化]<br>[4] muscle n.影响力 flexes its muscles 显示实力<br>[5] the struggle against 反…的斗争<br>[6] jihadism 圣战运动 [美国和法国正在为萨赫勒地区打击圣战主义的斗争提供力量和技术]<br>[7] sub-Saharan [sub-表示“下、在下”；表示“附属、下属”；表示“低于、次于”]<br>[8] defence-technology 国防科技<br>[9] sign deal with 与…签约 [俄罗斯与非洲国家签署了19项军事协议]<br>[10] The Horn of Africa 非洲之角<br>[11] mercenary n.雇佣兵;adj.惟利是图的 </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Commercial ties are being upended<sup>[1]</sup>. As recently as 2006 Africa’s three biggest trading partners were America, China and France, in that order. By 2018 it was China first, India second and America third (France was seventh). Over the same period Africa’s trade has more than trebled<sup>[2]</sup> with Turkey and Indonesia, and more than quadrupled<sup>[3]</sup> with Russia. Trade with the European Union has grown by a more modest<sup>[4]</sup> 41%. The biggest sources of foreign direct investment are still firms from America, Britain and France, but Chinese ones, including state-backed outfits<sup>[5]</sup>, are catching up, and investors from India and Singapore are eager to join the fray<sup>[6]</sup>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] upend v.颠倒[系正在被颠覆]<br>[2] treble (1)v.使增加两倍;增加两倍 (2)PREDET 3倍的 [非洲与土耳其和印度尼西亚的贸易增长了两倍多]<br>[3] quadruple (1)v.使成4倍;成为4倍 (2)PREDET 4倍的<br>[4] modest (1)adj.适度的;(数量、比率或改进幅度等)较小的;谦虚的 sb ~ (2)adv.较小地;谦虚地<br>[5] state-backed outfits 国家支持的机构  state-backed 国家支持的 outfit n.全套服装;机构<br>[6] fray v.磨损;烦躁 n.大声争论;打架;争吵 join the fray 加入战斗/加入竞争 [正在迎头赶上(are catching up)]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The stereotype<sup>[1]</sup> of foreigners in Africa is of neocolonial exploiters<sup>[2]</sup>, interested only in the continent’s natural resources, not its people, and ready to bribe<sup>[3]</sup> local bigwigs<sup>[4]</sup> in shady<sup>[5]</sup> deals that do nothing for ordinary Africans.<sup>[6]</sup> The stereotype is sometimes true. Far too many oil and mineral ventures<sup>[7]</sup> are dirty. Corrupt<sup>[8]</sup> African leaders, of whom there is still an abundance, can always find foreign enablers<sup>[9]</sup> to launder the loot<sup>[10]</sup>. And contracts with firms from countries that care little for<sup>[11]</sup> transparency, such as China and Russia, are often murky<sup>[12]</sup>. Three Russian journalists were murdered<sup>[13]</sup> last year while investigating a Kremlin-linked<sup>[14]</sup> mercenary outfit that reportedly<sup>[15]</sup> protects the president of the war-torn<sup>[16]</sup> Central African Republic and enables diamond-mining there.<sup>[17]</sup> Understandably, many saw a whiff of old-fashioned imperialism<sup>[18]</sup>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] stereotype [刻板印象] n.模式化形象;成见 v.把…模式化;对…产生成见<br>[2] neocolonial exploiters 新殖民主义剥削者 neocolonial adj.新殖民主义的 exploiter n.剥削者<br>[3] bribe n.[c]/v.贿赂<br>[4] bigwig n.[c]头儿(权贵之人;有重大影响的人)<br>[5] shady adj.(1)阴凉的;背阴的(2)可疑的;不法的<br>[6] 外国人在非洲的/刻板印象是/新殖民主义的剥削者,他们只对非洲大陆的自然资源感兴趣,而对非洲人民没有兴趣,他们/准备/贿赂当地的权贵,进行/对普通非洲人毫无益处的/不正当/交易.<br>[7] venture n.风险项目;冒险活动 v.冒险去(某处) ~ sw;冒险(做某事) ~ to do sth;试探地提出(问题或观点) ~ a question or statement;冒险(从事活动) ~ into an activity [太多的石油和矿产企业是肮脏的]<br>[8] corrupt adj.腐败的 v.使…腐化;腐化sb is corrupted by sth;使…堕落 ~ sb<br>[9] enabler n.促成事情成功的人或因素<br>[10] launder the loot 洗黑钱 launder v.洗(钱) n.洗钱者 loot 赃物[仍然有大量腐败的非洲领导人总能找到外国的帮凶来洗黑钱]<br>[11] care little for 不注重 [与中国和俄罗斯等/几乎不关心透明度的/国家的/公司/签订的/合同/往往是/模糊不清的]<br>[12] murky adj.阴暗的;混浊的;含糊不清的; 晦涩难懂的<br>[13] murder v./n.谋杀 (sb gets away with murder)无法无天为所欲为<br>[14] link 认为…有关联 ~ sb or sth to another [investigate n./v.调查 Kremlin-linked 与克里姆林宫有关的]<br>[15] reportedly adv.据报道;据说<br>[16] war-torn adj.受战争严重破坏的;饱受战争蹂躏的<br>[17] 去年,三名俄罗斯记者在调查一个与克里姆林宫有关联的雇佣军组织时被谋杀,据报道,该组织保护饱受战争蹂躏的中非共和国的总统,并在那里开采钻石.<br>[18] a whiff of old-fashioned imperialism 一丝旧式帝国主义的味道 a whiff of 一点点;一股…味道 old-fashion 老式的 imperialism n.[un]帝国主义</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, engagement with the outside world has mostly been positive for Africans. Foreigners build ports, sell insurance and bring mobile-phone technology. Chinese factories hum in Ethiopia and Rwanda. Turkish Airlines flies to more than 50 African cities. Greater openness to trade and investment is one reason why gdp per head south of the Sahara is two-fifths higher than it was in 2000. (Sounder macroeconomic policies and fewer wars also helped.) Africans can benefit when foreigners buy everything from textiles to holidays and digital services.</p>\n<p>Even so, Africans can do more to increase their share of the benefits. First, voters and activists can insist on transparency. It is heartening that South Africa is investigating the allegedly crooked deals struck under the previous president, Jacob Zuma, but alarming that even worse behaviour in the Democratic Republic of Congo has gone unprobed, and that the terms of Chinese loans to some dangerously indebted African governments are secret. To be sure that a public deal is good for ordinary folk as well as big men, voters have to know what is in it. Journalists, such as the Kenyans who exposed scandals over a Chinese railway project, have a big role to play.</p>\n<p>Second, Africa’s leaders need to think more strategically. Africa may be nearly as populous as China, but it comprises 54 countries, not one. African governments could strike better deals if they showed more unity. No one expects a heterogeneous continent that includes both anarchic battle zones and prosperous democracies to be as integrated as Europe. But it can surely do better than letting China negotiate with each country individually, behind closed doors. The power imbalance between, say, China and Uganda is huge. It could be reduced somewhat with a free-trade area or if African regional blocs clubbed together. After all, the benefits of infrastructure projects spill across borders.</p>\n<p>Third, African leaders do not have to choose sides, as they did during the cold war. They can do business with Western democracies and also with China and Russia—and anyone else with something to offer. Because they have more choice now than ever before, Africans should be able to drive harder bargains. And outsiders should not see this as a zero-sum contest (as the Trump administration, when it pays attention to Africa, apparently does). If China builds a bridge in Ghana, an American car can drive over it. If a British firm invests in a mobile-data network in Kenya, a Kenyan entrepreneur can use it to set up a cross-border startup.</p>\n<p>Last, Africans should take what some of their new friends tell them with a pinch of salt. China argues that democracy is a Western idea; development requires a firm hand. This message no doubt appeals to African strongmen, but it is bunk. A study by Takaaki Masaki of the World Bank and Nicolas van de Walle of Cornell University found that African countries grow faster if they are more democratic. The good news is that, as education improves and Africans move rapidly to the cities, they are growing more critical of their rulers, and less frightened to say so. In 1997, 70% of African ruling parties won more than 60% of the vote, partly by getting rural chiefs to cow villagers into backing them. By 2015 only 50% did. As politics grows more competitive, voters’ clout will grow. And they will be able to insist on a form of globalisation that works for Africans and foreigners alike.</p>\n","link":"/post/The-Economist-Week-2"}
