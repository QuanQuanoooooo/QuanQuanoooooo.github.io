When tensions<sup>[2]</sup> rise, one side will subject<sup>[3]</sup> the other to a blistering<sup>[4]</sup> artillery barrage<sup>[5]</sup>. On occasion<sup>[6]</sup>, the two have sent soldiers on forays<sup>[7]</sup> into one another’s territory. But since the feuding<sup>[8]</sup> neighbours tested nuclear weapons in the late 1990s, neither had dared<sup>[9]</sup> send fighter jets across the frontier<sup>[10]</sup> until this week. After a terrorist<sup>[11]</sup> group based<sup>[12]</sup> in Pakistan launched<sup>[13]</sup> an attack in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir that killed 40 soldiers, India responded by bombing what it said was a terrorist training camp in the Pakistani state of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.<sup>[14]</sup> Pakistan retaliated<sup>[15]</sup> by sending jets of its own to bomb Indian targets. In the ensuing<sup>[16]</sup> air battle, both sides claim to have shot down the other’s aircraft, and Pakistan captured an Indian pilot</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] disputed 有争议的<br>[2] tension (1)un-紧张;(2)var-|c/un|-冲突<br>[3] subject (1)v. you subject sb to sth unpleasant 使遭受;(2)adj. to be subject to something 受…影响的;to be subjected to bombing;(3)PHRASE:take place subject to a condition 取决于<br>[4] blistering adj. 激烈的<br>[5] artillery barrage 炮火<br>[6] on occasion=occasionally=from time to time 有时<br>[7] foray (1)初步尝试 to make a foray into;(2)突袭 to make a foray against/into sth: sent soldiers on forays into 派士兵进行突击;(3)v.对……突袭 to foray into<br>[8] feuding 世仇<br>[9] dare (1)情态动词+v原形;(2)v.有人称时态变化 dare (to) do sth.-否/疑省略to<br>[10] frontier 边界<br>[11] terrorist 恐怖分子<br>[12] base v. ~ sb/sth/yourself in 以…为据点(或总部等);把(总部等)设在<br>[13] launch (1)v. launch a large and important activity e.g. a military attack, means to start it 发起-launch an attack 发难;(2)v.

The fighting is already the fiercest<sup>[4]</sup> between the two countries since India battled to expel Pakistani intruders from high in the Himalayas in 1999. The initial Indian air raid<sup>[5]</sup> struck not Pakistan’s bit of Kashmir, but well within Pakistan proper<sup>[6]</sup> and just 100km from the capital, Islamabad. That, in effect, constituted<sup>[7]</sup> a change in the rules of engagement<sup>[8]</sup> between the two (see article). India and Pakistan are so often at odds<sup>[9]</sup> that there is a tendency to shrug off<sup>[10]</sup> their spats<sup>[11]</sup>, but not since their most recent, full-blown<sup>[12]</sup> war in 1971 has the risk of escalation<sup>[13]</sup> been so high.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] miscalculation 误算<br>[2] spell v. If something spells a particular outcome, often an unpleasant one 预示 (通常不好的结果)<br>[3] calamity (1)var-|c/un|-灾难<br>[4] fiercest adj.

Pakistan has long backed<sup>[2]</sup> terrorists who mount grisly<sup>[3]</sup> attacks in India, most notably in Mumbai in 2008, when jihadists who arrived by boat from Pakistan killed some 165 people. Although Pakistan’s army promised then to shut down<sup>[4]</sup> such extremist<sup>[5]</sup> groups, it has not. By responding more forcefully<sup>[6]</sup> than usual to the latest outrage<sup>[7]</sup>, Mr Modi understandably wanted to signal that he was not willing to allow Pakistan to keep sponsoring terrorism.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] order v.命令;n.顺序/秩序<br>[2] back v. 支持(If you back a person or a course of action, you support them, for example, by voting for them or giving them money.)<br>[3] grisly adj.  恐怖的( extremely unpleasant)<br>[4] shut down (使）歇业 Smaller contractors had been forced to shut down.<br>[5] extremist n.极端分子;adj.极端主义的<br>[6] forcefully adv. 强有力地<br>[7] outrage v.使震怒;n.令人震怒之事;adj.震怒的<br>[8] 莫迪对/最近令人震怒的事/做出了/比以往更有力的/回应，这是可以理解的，他想要表明，他不愿意/让巴基斯坦/继续资助/恐怖主义。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the long run, stability depends on Pakistan ending its indefensible<sup>[1]</sup> support for terrorism. Its prime minister, Imran Khan, is urging<sup>[2]</sup> dialogue and, in a promising gesture, was due to release India’s pilot—presumably<sup>[3]</sup> with the approval of the army chief, who calls the shots on<sup>[4]</sup> matters of security.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] indefensible adj.站不住脚的;无法防御的<br>[2] urge v. urge sb to do sth 敦促(某人做某事);urge sb sw 鼓动(某人去某地);urge a course of action 竭力主张;n.have an urge to do 强烈欲望<br>[3] presumably adv.很可能<br>[4] calls the shots on 在…发号施令<br>[5] 巴基斯坦总理伊姆兰·汗(Imran Khan)敦促/双方进行对话，并/以一种有希望的姿态/释放了印度的飞行员/——想必是/得到了/在安全问题上发号施令的/陆军参谋长的/批准。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But in the short run Mr Modi shares the responsibility to<sup>[1]</sup> stop a disastrous escalation. Because he faces an election in April, he faces the hardest and most consequential<sup>[2]</sup> calculations<sup>[3]</sup>. They<sup>[4]</sup> could come to define his premiership<sup>[5]</sup>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] shares the responsibility to 分担责任<br>[2] consequential adj.重要的<br>[3] calculations n.计算；the process of using your judgement to decide what the results would be of doing sth 估计；预测；推测<br>[4]They-&gt;the hardest and most consequential calculations.<br>[5]premiership 总理任期</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mr Modi has always presented himself as a bold and resolute<sup>[1]</sup> military leader, who does not shrink from confronting<sup>[2]</sup> Pakistan’s provocations<sup>[3]</sup>. He has taken to<sup>[4]</sup> repeating a catchphrase<sup>[5]</sup> from the film “Uri”, which portrays a commando raid<sup>[6]</sup> he ordered against Pakistan in 2016 in response to a previous terrorist attack as a moment of<sup>[7]</sup> chin-jutting grit<sup>[8]</sup>. The all-too-plausible<sup>[9]</sup> fear<sup>[10]</sup> is that his own tendency to swagger<sup>[11]</sup>, along with domestic political pressures, will spur<sup>[12]</sup> him further down the spiral<sup>[13]</sup> towards war.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] bold and resolute 果敢果决/大刀阔斧 bold:无畏的;大胆的 resolute:坚定的<br>[2] shrink from doing 在…前面退缩<br>[3] provocation 挑衅<br>[4] take to doing 喜欢上做某事/逐渐习惯做某事/开始做某事<br>[5] catchphrase n.名言;流行口号<br>[6] a commando raid 突击队的突袭行动<br>[7] as a moment of 作为…的时刻<br>[8] chin-jutting grit 下巴凸出的-&gt;突如其来的勇气 grit n.毅力;勇气 chin 下巴 jut v.突出伸出；抬起<br>[9] plausible adj.(解释或叙述)看似合理的<br>[10] fear 害怕;担忧;(发生坏事的)可能性<br>[11] swagger v.大摇大摆地走;趾高气扬地走[含贬义]<br>[12] spur v.spurs a change or event, it makes it happen faster or sooner. 使更快发生;加速 one thing spurs you to do another v.鼓动;激励=Spur on; n. as a spur to something 促进因素; 推动  on the spur of the moment 一时冲动之下<br>[13] spiral n.螺旋式运动-&gt;逐渐加速上升(或下降) downward/upward spiral<br>[14] 最让人担心的是，他自己的狂妄自大，加上国内的政治压力，将促使他/进一步/滑向/战争的/漩涡。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The ambiguity<sup>[1]</sup> of Mr Modi’s beliefs only deepens the danger. He campaigned<sup>[2]</sup> at the election in 2014 as a moderniser<sup>[3]</sup>, who would bring jobs and prosperity to India. But, his critics charge<sup>[4]</sup>, all his talk of development and reform is simply the fig leaf<sup>[5]</sup> for a lifelong commitment<sup>[6]</sup> to a divisive Hindu-nationalist agenda.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] ambiguity n-var 模棱两可<br>[2] campaign n.活动;运动/一系列军事行动;战役 v. campaigns for 从事运动/领导运动(如为实现政治变革或赢得竞选胜利)<br>[3] moderniser 现代主义者<br>[4] charge v.指控<br>[5] fig leaf  遮羞布; 掩盖行为<br>[6] commitment n.投身的事;承诺<br>[7] 但是，他的批评者指责说，所有有关发展和改革的言论，都不过是他毕生致力于印度教民族主义这一分裂议程的遮羞布。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over the past five years Mr Modi has lived up<sup>[1]</sup> neither to the hype<sup>[2]</sup> nor to the dire<sup>[3]</sup> warnings. The economy has grown strongly under his leadership, by around 7% a year. He has brought about reforms his predecessors had promised but never delivered<sup>[4]</sup>, such as a nationwide goods-and-services<sup>[5]</sup> tax (gst).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] lived up to 不辜负<br>[2] hype n.[传媒的]大肆宣传，炒作[含贬义]<br>[3] dire adj.可怕的;质量低劣的<br>[4] delivere v.递送 deliver something that you have promised to do 实现;履行 deliver a lecture or speech 发表<br>[5] goods-and-services 商品及服务<br> [6] 过去5年，莫迪/既没有/辜负/大肆宣传，也没有/兑现/可怕的警告…他推行了/前任承诺/但从未兑现的/改革，比如全国性的商品及服务税(gst)。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But unemployment has actually risen during Mr Modi’s tenure<sup>[1]</sup>, according to leaked<sup>[2]</sup> data that his government has been accused of<sup>[3]</sup> trying to suppress (see article). The gst was needlessly<sup>[4]</sup> complex and costly to administer<sup>[5]</sup>. Other pressing<sup>[6]</sup> reforms have fallen by the wayside<sup>[7]</sup>. India’s banks are still largely in state hands, still prone to lend to the well-connected<sup>[8]</sup>. And as the election has drawn closer, Mr Modi has resorted<sup>[9]</sup> to politically expedient<sup>[10]</sup> policies that are likely to harm the economy. His government hounded<sup>[11]</sup> the boss of the central bank out of office for keeping interest rates high, appointing<sup>[12]</sup> a replacement who promptly<sup>[13]</sup> cut them. And it has unveiled<sup>[14]</sup> draft<sup>[15]</sup> rules that would protect domestic e-commerce firms from competition from retailers such as Amazon.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] tenure n.任期[un]<br>[2] leak v.(1)渗漏(液体或气体);(容器)渗漏 (2)泄露<br>[3] accuse of 指控某人做某事 ~ sb of doing suppress 禁止发表,查禁,封锁[消息或言论];抑制,克制[感情];[尤指用武力]镇压,制止,压制<br>[4] needlessly adv.不必要地;无用地<br>[5] costly to administer 管理成本高昂 administer v.监管(国家、法律、考试等); (医生、护士)派发(药物)administers a drug<br>[6] pressing adj.紧迫的<br>[7] falls by the wayside 半途而废 wayside n.路边<br>[8] prone to lend to the well-connected 倾向于借钱给有关系的人 prone to 倾向于 well-connected adj.社会关系优越的<br>[9] resort v.不得不求助 n.诉诸;(度假)胜地 as a last resort 作为最后手段<br>[10] expedient n.权宜之举 adj. 权宜的 ~ to do sth<br>[11] hound v.sb hounds you(不断地)烦扰;is hounded out of 迫使(某人)离开<br>[12] appoint v. ~ sb to a job or official position 任命<br>[13] promptly adv. 立即<br>[14] unveil v. 为…揭幕;公布unveil a plan, new product<br>[15] draft rule 草案 draft v. 草稿;初稿<br>[16] 但根据泄露的数据(他的政府被指控试图封锁)显示,在莫迪执政期间，失业率实际上有所上升. 消费税是不必要地复杂且管理成本高昂… 印度的银行很大程度上仍掌握在政府手中(in state hands),仍倾向于向人脉广泛的人放贷.随着大选的临近(draw closer)，莫迪/采取了/可能损害经济的/政治权宜之计.他的政府将央行行长赶出了办公室,原因是他将利率维持在高位,并任命了一位继任者,后者立即降低了利率…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By the same token<sup>[1]</sup>, Mr Modi has not sparked<sup>[2]</sup> the outright communal conflagration<sup>[3]</sup> his critics, The Economist included, fretted<sup>[4]</sup> about before he became prime minister.<sup>[5]</sup> But his government has often displayed<sup>[6]</sup> hostility<sup>[7]</sup> to India’s Muslim minority and sympathy for those who see Hinduism—the religion of 80% of Indians—as under threat from internal and external foes<sup>[8]</sup>. He has appointed a bigoted<sup>[9]</sup> Hindu prelate<sup>[10]</sup>, Yogi Adityanath, as chief minister of India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. A member of his cabinet<sup>[11]</sup> presented garlands<sup>[12]</sup> of flowers to a group of Hindu men who had been convicted<sup>[13]</sup> of lynching<sup>[14]</sup> a Muslim for selling beef (cows are sacred<sup>[15]</sup> to Hindus).<sup>[16]</sup> And Mr Modi himself has suspended<sup>[17]</sup> the elected government of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state, and used force to suppress protests<sup>[18]</sup> there against the central government, leading to horrific civilian casualties<sup>[19]</sup>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] by the same token 出于同样原因<br>[2] spark v.引发 one thing sparks another<br>[3] the outright communal conflagration 彻底的公共冲突 outright adv.完全彻底地;直率地 communal adj.团体的;共有的 conflagration 大火;火灾<br>[4] fret v.担心 fret about sth<br>[5] 莫迪并没有引发一场彻底的群体性冲突[(that)他的批评者(包括《经济学人》)在他成为总理之前担心的]<br>[6] display v.陈列;展出;表露(特点、素质、情感)<br>[7] hostility n.敌意;敌对;反对[un]<br>[8] foe n.敌人<br>[9] bigoted adj.偏执的<br>[10] prelate n.高级神职人员<br>[11] cabinet n.贮藏橱;陈列柜;内阁<br>[12] garland n.花环<br>[13] convict n.囚犯 v.证明…有罪<br>[14] lynch v.对…以私刑绞死 n.私刑绞死<br>[15] sacred adj.神圣的;宗教的;不容更改的;不容干涉的<br>[16]他的一名内阁成员向一群印度男子赠送了花环，这些人被判/谋杀一名穆斯林/因为他卖牛肉<br>[17] suspend v.暂停;使停职;悬挂<br>[18] force to suppress protests 用武力镇压(反对中央政府的)抗议活动 protest n.抗议[var] v.抗议;断言<br>[19] horrific civilian casualties 可怕的平民伤亡 casualty n.死伤者;受害者[un]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As reprehensible<sup>[1]</sup> as all this is, the Hindu zealots who staff Mr Modi’s electoral machine complain that he has not done enough to advance the Hindu cause (see article). And public dissatisfaction with his economic reforms has helped boost Congress, the main opposition party, making the election more competitive than had been expected.<sup>[2]</sup> The temptation<sup>[3]</sup> to fire up<sup>[4]</sup> voters using heated brinkmanship<sup>[5]</sup> with Pakistan will be huge.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] reprehensible adj.应受斥责的;应该谴责的[尽管这一切都应受到谴责]<br>[2] 公众/对他的经济改革/的不满/也帮助推动了国会(主要反对党),使选举比预期的更竞争性强.<br>[3] temptation n.诱惑<br>[4] fire up 发动(机器等);激励;鼓舞<br>[5] brinkmanship 边缘政策;故意陷入既可以导致灾难、也可能带来成功的一种政治策略<br>[6] 利用/与巴基斯坦的/激烈边缘政策/来煽动/选民的/诱惑/将是巨大的</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mr Modi has made a career of playing with fire.<sup>[1]</sup> He first rose to prominence<sup>[2]</sup> as chief minister of Gujarat when the state was racked by anti-Muslim pogroms<sup>[3]</sup> in 2002. Although there is no evidence he orchestrated the violence<sup>[4]</sup>, he has shown no compunction about capitalising on the popularity<sup>[5]</sup> it won him in Hindu-nationalist circles. With a difficult election ahead<sup>[6]</sup>, he may think he can pull off<sup>[7]</sup> the same trick<sup>[8]</sup> again by playing the tough guy<sup>[9]</sup> with Pakistan, but without actually getting into a fight. However, the price of miscalculation does not bear thinking about.<sup>[10]</sup> Western governments are pushing for a diplomatic settlement<sup>[11]</sup> at the UN. If Mr Modi really is a patriot<sup>[12]</sup>, he will now step back<sup>[13]</sup>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[1] make a career of 不厌其烦地做一件事[莫迪的职业生涯就是玩火]<br>[2] rose to prominence 声名鹊起 rise to v.恰当应对(要求,尤指考验) prominence n.著名;重要性[un]<br>[3] racked by anti-Muslim pogroms 饱受反穆斯林大屠杀的折磨 rack v.使痛苦 sb is racked by; pogrom n.大屠杀<br>[4] orchestrate the violence 精心策划了这次暴力事件 orchestrate v.精心组织 sb orchestrates an event or situation n.精心的安排[un]<br>[5] show no compunction about capitalising on the popularity 没有表现出关于利用人气的悔意 compunction n.[un]has no compunction about doing 悔恨 capitalise v.~ on 利用 popularity n.受欢迎;声望<br>[6] with a difficult election ahead 即将到来的是一场艰难的选举 ahead adv.在将来<br>[7] pull off 做成(某件难事)<br>[8] trick n.捉弄;诡计<br>[9] play the tough guy 扮演硬汉[他可能认为/他可以/通过对巴基斯坦采取强硬态度/来再次上演/同样的把戏,但/实际上/并不需要/投入战斗]<br>[10] 然而,误算的代价不容思考[并没有考虑到]<br>[12] push for a diplomatic settlement 推动外交解决 a diplomatic settlement 外交解决方式<br>[12] patriot n.爱国者[c]<br>[13] step back 退一步(思考)</p>\n</blockquote>\n","link":"/post/The-Economist-Week-1"}
